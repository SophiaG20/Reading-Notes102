#### Growth mindset in my own words:

###  -A challenge and also the future
### -Growth mindset is essential to enjoying this class Versus failing it
### -Growth Minset is a journey not a Milestone

Reminders for me to continue to grow

### 1. Put on my oxygen mask first: If Sophia is not okay, I cannot grow
### 2. There is help everywhere, I just need to think about why? and then How will come
### 3. The universe is on our side: The time is NOW!
