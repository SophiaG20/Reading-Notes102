# Sophia G20's thoughts on git 

- git and git hub are two diffrent things
-I am pretty sure when my granpa worked for NASA in the 50's to the early 90's he came across git
-git is the answer to the main sever going down and so that all the data doesn't get lost
-you can turn on auto save but it also comes with it's own headaches
-commit to your git is not what you would think it is . No GURL, there is no ring involved
