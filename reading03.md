###-Committing to your git is not what you would think it is. No GURL, there is no ring involved
###- git and git hub are two different things
###-I am pretty sure when my grandpa worked for NASA in the 50s to the early 90s, he came across git
###-git is the answer to the central server going down
###-you can turn on auto-save, but it also comes with its own headaches
