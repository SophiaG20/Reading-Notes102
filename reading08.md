- There are many types of Operators in JavaScript:
(I put an example next to each operator, but you might have noticed that Conditional has more text? That is because Conditional is a little different)

- Assignment: x = f()
- Comparison: Equal(==)
- Arithmetic: Increment (++)Bitwise
- Logical: Logical AND (&&)
- String: var mystring = 'alpha';
- Conditional: (The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition.) The syntax is: condition ? val1 : val2
- Comma:var x = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
- Unary:delete object.property;
- Relational: propNameOrNumber in objectName
