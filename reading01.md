# **Girl, markdown is so web3**
> Markdown is like 2 parts myspace and 1 part wordpress but also web 2

-How is it web 3, though?

> It is web 3 as in you use coding and it is a pain in the code

## But seriously Github is where many people share their code for web 3

- so it makes sense to blog on here
- the code is pretty friendly to grasp
- [This is the only site I used to make this page/blog](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)
